## YAML Configuration

### Structure and Organization

1. **Modular Configuration**
   - Break down large configurations into smaller, reusable components
   - Use includes and references to maintain DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
   - Group related configurations together

2. **Documentation**
   - Add comments to explain complex configurations
   - Document the purpose of each section
   - Include examples for common use cases

3. **Validation**
   - Use the schema validator to check configurations
   - Test configurations in a staging environment
   - Version control all configuration changes

### Example Structure

```yaml
# Common configuration
common: &common
  kubernetes:
    cloud: swx-k8s
  volumes:
    - {mountPath: /hpc/local, hostPath: /hpc/local}

# Job-specific configuration
job: my-job
<<: *common
steps:
  - name: Build
    run: make
```

## Container Management

### Container Selection

1. **Purpose-Specific Containers**
   - Use dedicated containers for specific tasks (build, test, scan)
   - Choose containers based on required tools and dependencies
   - Consider container size and startup time

2. **Container Reuse**
   - Group related steps to run in the same container
   - Cache dependencies between steps
   - Use container selectors effectively

### Example

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Setup Environment
    containerSelector: "{name: 'builder'}"
    run: |
      ./configure
      make deps

  - name: Build
    containerSelector: "{name: 'builder'}"
    run: make
```

## Build Optimization

### Performance Tips

1. **Parallel Execution**
   - Use matrix builds for testing multiple configurations
   - Enable parallel builds where possible
   - Utilize available CPU cores

2. **Caching**
   - Cache build artifacts between runs
   - Use volume mounts for persistent data
   - Implement proper cleanup

### Example

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Build
    run: make -j$(nproc)
    env:
      CCACHE_DIR: /cache/ccache

  - name: Cleanup
    always: |
      rm -rf build/temp
      find . -name "*.o" -delete
```

## Security Considerations

### Credential Management

1. **Secure Storage**
   - Use the credentials system for sensitive data
   - Never hardcode credentials in configurations
   - Rotate credentials regularly

2. **Access Control**
   - Implement least privilege principle
   - Use service accounts for Kubernetes access
   - Restrict artifact access

### Example

```yaml
credentials:
  - {credentialsId: 'secure-creds', usernameVariable: 'USER', passwordVariable: 'PASS'}

steps:
  - name: Secure Operation
    credentialsId: 'secure-creds'
    run: |
      echo "Using secure credentials"
```

## Error Handling

### Robust Pipeline Design

1. **Failure Management**
   - Use `failFast: false` for critical paths
   - Implement proper error handling in scripts
   - Add cleanup steps for resource management

2. **Logging and Monitoring**
   - Archive important logs
   - Implement proper exit codes
   - Use descriptive error messages

### Example

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Critical Operation
    run: |
      set -e
      ./critical_operation.sh || {
        echo "Operation failed"
        exit 1
      }

  - name: Cleanup
    always: |
      ./cleanup.sh
```

## Resource Management

### Efficient Resource Usage

1. **Container Resources**
   - Specify resource limits for containers
   - Monitor resource usage
   - Clean up unused resources

2. **Artifact Management**
   - Archive only necessary artifacts
   - Implement retention policies
   - Clean up old artifacts

### Example

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Resource Intensive Operation
    containerSelector: "{name: 'heavy-lifter'}"
    resources:
      limits:
        cpu: "2"
        memory: "4Gi"
    run: ./heavy_operation.sh

  - name: Cleanup
    always: |
      kubectl delete pod --all
      rm -rf /tmp/*
```

## General Recommendations

1. **Version Control**
   - Keep all configurations in version control
   - Use meaningful commit messages
   - Document changes in changelog

2. **Testing**
   - Test configurations in staging
   - Implement automated testing
   - Use matrix builds for comprehensive testing

3. **Maintenance**
   - Regularly update container images
   - Monitor pipeline performance
   - Review and optimize configurations

4. **Documentation**
   - Keep documentation up to date
   - Include examples for common tasks
   - Document known issues and workarounds
